value purchase for the common man. And quite ironically, the average life span of a car is going down despite the steady rise in prices, which brings in 
good news for potential used car buyers. 
2]In 2018-19, while new car sales were recorded at 3.6 million units, 4 million second-hand cars were bought and sold, according to a recent report on 
Indiaâ€™s pre-owned car market by IndianBlueBook, a used car pricing guide by Mahindra First Choice Wheels.In many cases, a three-year-old vehicle is as 
good as a new one, which encourages the buyer to go for a used car. 
3]As coming to indian economy 6.7% people are under poverty 
ratio and they cant afford to buy new cars as this data can give idea or knowledge to the people about which car brand and car models is suitable to them.
